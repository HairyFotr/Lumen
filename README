 LUMEN - Drawing in augmented reality
--------------------------------------
 by Dominik Mahnič and Matic Potočnik
 produced by: LJUDMILA
 coproduced by: Computer Vision Laboratory, FRI

Hardware used:
    Microsoft Kinect sensor (probably anything OpenNI-compatible goes)
    Vuzix Wrap 920AR 3D glasses (tracker code is pretty hacky and hardcoded)
    
Software used:
    OpenNI, OpenCV, OpenGL, ...

How to build?
    Install these (OpenCV, Boost threads, OpenNI prereqs):
        sudo apt-get install libcv-dev libopencv-dev libboost-thread-dev 
        sudo apt-get install realpath g++ python libusb-1.0-0-dev freeglut3-dev

    Download OpenNI, SensorKinect, NITE Middleware:
        OpenNI and NITE:
            http://openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx
        SensorKinect:
            https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect/tree/unstable/Bin
    
    Now extract these and run sudo ./install in all three
        
    Move the extracted OpenNI folder to lib/OpenNI (check src/Makefile)

    Check if $arch in the run script is the right one for your linux.
    
    OK, it should now build and start with ./run
    
Now what?
    The code is ugly, and there are a lot of magical numbers for
    you to play with, but the first one you'll want to set is
    the angle correction around line 1000 - glasses heading
    goes towards North, but should go towards Kinect.
    
TODO:
    Driver for Vuzix Wrap 920AR (check wrap920AR/)
    Major cleanup and modularization
    Automatic Kinect-Tracker calibration
    Try it out on different hardware
    Saving and screenshots
    Better graphics (use a game engine perhaps)

License stuff:
    Yeah, we should get this in proper order.
    It's LGPL, like the DCM algorithm we used, 
    and the OpenNI example we built this upon.

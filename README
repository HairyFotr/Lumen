 LUMEN - Drawing in augmented reality
--------------------------------------
 by Dominik Mahnič and Matic Potočnik

Hardware stuff used:
    Microsoft Kinect sensor (probably anything OpenNI-compatible goes)
    Vuzix Wrap 920AR 3D glasses (tracker code is pretty hacky and hardcoded to it)
    
Software stuff used:
    Ubuntu, OpenNI, OpenCV, OpenGL, ...

How to build?
    You maybe need these (OpenCV, Boost threads, realpath (for glasses detection), OpenNI prereqs):
        sudo apt-get install libcv-dev libopencv-dev libboost-thread-dev realpath g++ python libusb-1.0-0-dev freeglut3-dev

    Install OpenNI, SensorKinect, NITE Middleware
        http://75.98.78.94/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx
        https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect/tree/unstable/Bin
        
    Also put OpenNI in lib/OpenNI ... check src/Makefile

    Check run script if $arch and stuff looks good.
    
    OK, it should build...
    
Now what?
    The code is ugly, and there are a lot of magical numbers for
    you to play with, but the first one you'll want to set is
    the angle correction around line 1000 - glasses heading
    goes towards North, but should go towards Kinect.
    
TODO:
    Major cleanup and compartmentalization :)
    Automatic kinect-tracker calibration
    Try it on different hardware
    Saving and screenshots
    Better graphics
    License stuffs:
        Yeah, we should get this in order.
        It'll be LGPL, like the DCM algorithm
        we used, and the OpenNI example we built from
